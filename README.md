Torrent File Copier

Is a windows service that monitors a specified directory (using FileSystemWatcher), and copied files to a specified directory, 
and into sub folders based on the name, if the file does not exist already.

This is the first windows service I have done.  I used 4 different "how to" guides for guidance, and took the parts of each that I liked.

Right now (21 Jan 2018) it logs to a text file (specified in the code), but has the code to also log to the Event Viewer (not working 100%).
